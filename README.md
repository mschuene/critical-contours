This repository contains the text and code for my master thesis

Feature integration with critical dynamics
numerical studies and mathematical analysis

The whole thesis, including figures and code is contained in the
file master.org in a literate programming style to ensure reproducibility.

The implementation is done in python - using the ob-ipython interface
for Emacs org-mode - and c++11 for performance critical parts, which
are interfaced using the pybind11 library.
